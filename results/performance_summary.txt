🧐 ANALYSIS AND OBSERVATIONS
============================================================

1. PERFORMANCE COMPARISON:
   - SVM achieved the highest accuracy, followed closely by KNN
   - Decision Tree performed slightly worse but was faster to train
   - From-scratch KNN showed competitive performance despite implementation simplicity

2. MISCLASSIFICATION PATTERNS:
   - Most confusion occurs between visually similar digits (e.g., 3↔8, 4↔9, 5↔6)
   - Noisy or poorly written digits were most frequently misclassified
   - Edge cases with unusual writing styles caused consistent errors
